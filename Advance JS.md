1. **Closures**: Functions that retain access to their outer scope variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

2. **Promises**: Objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.

3. **Async/Await**: Syntax for writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making it easier to read and debug.

4. **Prototypes and Inheritance**: Mechanism for objects to share properties and methods, allowing for reusable and extendable code.

5. **JavaScript Engines**: Programs that execute JavaScript code, such as V8 in Chrome and SpiderMonkey in Firefox.

6. **Event Loop**: Mechanism that handles asynchronous operations by queuing tasks and executing them in order.

7. **Memory Management**: The process of allocating and freeing up memory used by your JavaScript code to prevent leaks and optimize performance.

8. **Module Pattern**: Technique for encapsulating and organizing code into reusable modules, often using IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).

9. **Currying and Partial Application**: Techniques for creating functions with preset arguments and breaking down functions into simpler functions.

10. **Function Composition**: Combining multiple functions to create a new function that performs a series of operations in sequence.

11. **Decorators**: Special syntax to modify or enhance functions and classes in a declarative way.

12. **Generators**: Functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing for the generation of a sequence of values over time.

13. **Symbols**: Unique and immutable values used primarily as object property keys to avoid name collisions.

14. **WeakMap and WeakSet**: Collections that hold weak references to objects, allowing for garbage collection when objects are no longer needed.

15. **Reflect API**: Provides methods to interact with objects and their prototypes, offering a more consistent way to perform low-level operations.

16. **Proxy API**: Allows you to create a proxy object that can intercept and redefine operations performed on another object.

17. **Meta Programming**: Techniques for manipulating and modifying code behavior at runtime using features like proxies and reflection.

18. **ES6+ Features**: New language features introduced in ECMAScript 6 and beyond, such as arrow functions, classes, and template literals.

19. **Context and `this`**: Refers to the object that is executing the current function or method, and how it is dynamically determined in JavaScript.

20. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results, enabling powerful functional programming techniques.
